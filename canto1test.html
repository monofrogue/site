<p class="p2"><i>The poet invokes the aid of Apollo in attempting the hardest part of his theme, the description of Paradise.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><i>On earth, in Italy, it is evening; but at the summit of the Mount of Purgatory it is near noon about the time of the vernal equinox; the sun being in Aries, a propitious conjunction. Dante and Beatrice are suddenly transported to the sphere of fire, between the earth and the moon. Dante is so “transhumanised” that he is now able to hear the music of the spheres; but at first he is bewildered, not understanding, till Beatrice explains that he has left the earth behind. He is still puzzled to know how it is that he has risen, more swiftly than air or fire, against the laws of gravitation. Beatrice tells him that the instinct implanted in the soul is to rise, as fire rises, towards heaven; this belongs to the order of the universe, in which each part has its own function. Dante has been liberated from the distractions which, through man’s possession of free will, sometimes cause the soul to be diverted from its aim.</i></p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p2">THE glory of Him who moveth all that is</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Pervades the universe, and glows more bright</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In the one region, and in another less.</p>
<p class="p2">In that heaven which partakes most of His light</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I have been, and have beheld such things as who</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Comes down thence has no wit nor power to write;</p>
<p class="p2">Such depth our understanding deepens to</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>When it draws near unto its longing’s home</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>That memory cannot backward with it go.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless what of the blest kingdom<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[10]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Could in my memory, for its treasure, stay</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Shall now the matter of my song become.</p>
<p class="p2">For the last labour, good Apollo, I pray,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Make me so apt a vessel of thy power</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As is required for gift of thy loved bay.<span class="tooltip">[i]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>15. “Loved bay”: Daphne, loved and pursued by Apollo, was changed to a laurel.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2">One of Parnassus’ peaks hath heretofore</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Sufficed me; both now shall I need forthwith</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>For entering on the last arena-floor.</p>
<p class="p2">Enter into my bosom, and in-breathe</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Such force as filled thee to out-sing the strain<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[20]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Of Marsyas when thou didst his limbs unsheathe.<span class="tooltip">[ii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>21. “Marsyas”: a satyr, who was defeated and then flayed by Apollo.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2">O divine power, if thou so far sustain,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>That I may show the image visibly</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Of the holy realm imprinted on my brain,</p>
<p class="p2">Thou'lt see me come to thy beloved tree<span class="tooltip">[iii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>25. “Thy beloved tree”: the laurel.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>And there the leaves upon my temples fit</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Which I shall earn both through the theme and thee.</p>
<p class="p2">So few times, Father, is there plucked of it</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>For Caesar or for poet triumphing</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(Fault and reproach of human will and wit),<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[30]</span></p>
<p class="p2">That in the joyous Delphic god must spring<span class="tooltip">[iv]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>31-32. “The joyous Delphic god”: Apollo. “The Peneian frond”: the laurel.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A joy new-born, when the Peneian frond</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With longing for itself doth any sting.</p>
<p class="p2">A small spark kindles a great flame beyond:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Haply after me with better voice than mine</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Such prayer shall plead, that Cirrha may respond.<span class="tooltip">[v]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>36. “Cirrha” stands for Delphi, Apollo’s abode.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2">The world’s lamp rises upon men to shine<span class="tooltip">[vi]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>37-44. In these lines Dante describes the season. The sun, being almost in the sign of Aries, has the most benign influence on the earth.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>By divers gates, but from that gate which makes</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Four circles with three crosses to conjoin,</p>
<p class="p2">With happier star joined, happier course it takes,<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[40]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>And more to its own example can persuade,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Moulding and stamping it, the mundane wax.</p>
<p class="p2">Almost this gate had morning yonder made</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>And evening here; and there that hemisphere<span class="tooltip">[vii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>44-45. Here Dante tells the hour: it was noon in Eden, midnight in Jerusalem.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Was all white, and the other part in shade,</p>
<p class="p2">When, turned on her left side, I was aware</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Of Beatrice, fixing on the sun her eyes:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Never on it so fixed was eagle’s stare.</p>
<p class="p2">And as a second ray will always rise</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Where the first struck, and backward seek ascent,<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[50]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Like pilgrim hastening when he homeward hies,</p>
<p class="p2">So into my imagination went</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Through the eyes her gesture; and my own complied,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>And on the sun, past wont, my eyes were bent.</p>
<p class="p2">Much is permitted there which is denied</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Here to our faculties, thanks to the place<span class="tooltip">[viii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>56. “Thanks to the place”: Eden.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Made for mankind to own, and there abide.</p>
<p class="p2">Not long I endured him, yet not so brief space</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>But that I saw what sparkles round him shone</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Like molten ore fresh from the fierce furnace;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[60]</span></p>
<p class="p2">And, on a sudden, day seemed added on</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>To day, as if He, who such things can do,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Had glorified heaven with a second sun.</p>
<p class="p2">Beatrice was standing and held full in view</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The eternal wheels, and I fixed on her keen<span class="tooltip">[ix]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>65. “The eternal wheels”: the revolving heavens.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>My eyes, that from above their gaze withdrew.</p>
<p class="p2">And at her aspect I became within</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As Glaucus after the herb’s tasting, whence<span class="tooltip">[x]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>68. The fisherman Glaucus, tasting of a certain herb, became a sea-god.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>To the other sea-gods he was made akin.</p>
<p class="p2">The passing beyond bounds of human sense<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[70]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Words cannot tell; let then the example sate</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Him for whom grace reserves the experience.</p>
<p class="p2">If I was only what thou didst create<span class="tooltip">[xi]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>73. Dante is not sure whether he took his body with him to Heaven, or left it behind.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Last in me, O Love whose rule the heavens attest,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Thou know’st, who with thy light didst lift my state.</p>
<p class="p2">When that the wheel which thou eternisest</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In longing, held me with the harmony<span class="tooltip">[xii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>77. The swift motion of the </i>Primum Mobile<i>, the outermost sphere of the material universe, is due to the eagerness of every one of its parts to come into contact with every part of God’s own Heaven, the Empyrean.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Which thou attunest and distinguishest,</p>
<p class="p2">So much of heaven was fired, it seemed to me,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With the sun’s blaze that never river or rain<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[80]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Widened the waters to so great a sea.</p>
<p class="p2">The new sound and the great light made me fain</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With craving keener than had ever been</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Before in me, their cause to ascertain.</p>
<p class="p2">She then, who saw me as I myself within,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>My mind’s disturbance eager to remit,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Opened her lips before I could begin,</p>
<p class="p2">And spoke: “Thou makest thyself dense of wit</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With false fancy, so that thou dost not see</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>What thou would’st see, wert thou but rid of it.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[90]</span></p>
<p class="p2">Thou’rt not on earth, as thou supposest thee:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>But lightning from its own place rushing out</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Ne’er sped as thou, who to thy home dost flee.”<span class="tooltip">[xiii]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>93. “Thy home”: the Empyrean.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2">If I was stript of my first teasing doubt</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>By the brief smiling little words, yet freed</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>I was not, but enmeshed in a new thought.</p>
<p class="p2">And I replied: “I am released indeed</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>From much amazement; yet am still amazed</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>That those light bodies I transcend in speed.”</p>
<p class="p2">She, sighing in pity, gave me as she gazed<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[100]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The look that by a mother is bestowed</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Upon her child in its delirium crazed,</p>
<p class="p2">And said: “All things, whatever their abode,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Have order among themselves; this Form it is</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>That makes the universe like unto God.</p>
<p class="p2">Here the high beings see the imprint of His</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Eternal power, which is the goal divine</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Whereto the rule aforesaid testifies.</p>
<p class="p2">In the order I speak of, all natures incline</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Either more near or less near to their source<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[110]</span><span class="tooltip">[xiv]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>110. “Their source”: God.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>According as their diverse lots assign.</p>
<p class="p2">To diverse harbours thus they move perforce</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>O’er the great ocean of being, and each one</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With instinct given it to maintain its course.</p>
<p class="p2">This bears the fiery element to the moon;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This makes the heart of mortal things to move;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This knits the earth together into one.</p>
<p class="p2">Not only creatures that are empty of</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Intelligence this bow shoots towards the goal,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>But those that have both intellect and love.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[120]</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Providence, that rules this wondrous whole,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>With its own light makes the heaven still to stay<span class="tooltip">[xv]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>122-125. “The heaven”: the Empyrean, within which the swift </i>Primum Mobile<i> revolves. “That cord”: the bowstring of instinct.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Wherein whirls that which doth the swiftest roll.</p>
<p class="p2">And thither now upon the appointed way</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>We are borne on by virtue of that cord still</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Which means a joyful mark, shoot what it may.</p>
<p class="p2">True it is that as the form oftentimes ill</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Accordeth with the intention of the art,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The matter being slow to serve the will,</p>
<p class="p2">So aside sometimes may the creature start;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[130]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>For it has power, though on this course impelled,<span class="tooltip">[xvi]<span class="tooltiptext"><i>131. “For it has power”: the free will.</i></span></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>To swerve in purpose toward some other part</p>
<p class="p2">(And so the fire from cloud may be beheld</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>To fall), if the first impulse of its flight</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>To earth be wrested, by false pleasure held.</p>
<p class="p2">Thou should’st not marvel, if I esteem aright,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>More at thy rising than at streams we see</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Fall to the base down from a mountain’s height;</p>
<p class="p2">Marvel it were if thou, from hindrance free,</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Had’st sat below, resolved there to remain,<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="s1">[140]</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>As stillness in live flame on earth would be.”</p>
<p class="p2">Thereon toward heaven she turned her gaze again.</p>
