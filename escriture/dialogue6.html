    <p>—and i should pray and pray aright.</p>
    <p>—and pray, sir, tell me what it is to pray aright.</p>
    <p>—why, sir, 'tis nothing but to pray with all sincerity.</p>
    <p>—and with all sincerity you tell me that is nothing?</p>
    <p>—why, 'tis nothing indeed.</p>
    <p>—why, 'tis nothing indeed to say that 'tis nothing.</p>
    <p>—then you think me insincere?</p>
    <p>—no, i' faith, i think you insensible.</p>
    <p>—then you cannot be sincere in faith to think me insensible to say 'tis nothing to pray with all sincerity.</p>
    <p>—why, i am sincere indeed in faith and in that am i sensible that 'tis not indeed nothing.</p>
    <p>—why, have you never prayed aright?</p>
    <p>—and, pray, once more, sir, what is it to pray aright?</p>
    <p>—why, sir, 'tis—</p>
    <p>—why, sir, 'tis everything to me, and that is why i cannot answer, and, sir, since i cannot answer, why, i cannot see that your assuredness is sound.</p>
    <p>—you think me unsound?</p>
    <p>—in this i do.</p>
    <p>—but what would it be to be sound in this?</p>
    <p>—why to be sound is all that there is.</p>
    <p>—indeed no, 'though there is always sound, if only the groans in our weakness.</p>
    <p>—but to pray aright is to rid our prayers of weakness.</p>
    <p>—but indeed if it anything to pray aright, it must only be to be aware of the weakness with which we pray.</p>
    <p>—then i must pray, and pray aright.</p>
