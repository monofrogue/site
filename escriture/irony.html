    <h1>Irony</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="main_section">
    <p class="p1">A mouse had just been eaten by a cat. ‘I suppose,’ he said to himself, ‘I suppose that I should have liked to keep on living. But at least,’ he said, he said to himself, ‘At least I had an ironic death.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Did you say,’ asked Death, whom the mouse suddenly noticed, ‘Did you say that you had had an ironic death?’</p>
<p class="p1">‘I did,’ said the mouse, tugging on his whiskers. ‘I did say that, for that is what I have had. And I am mighty glad of it. You see, for as long as I knew what irony was, I have always wanted an ironic death. In fact, I wanted one more than anything else in the world, except for perhaps no death at all.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Ah,’ said Death, tugging on his own whiskers.</p>
<p class="p1">‘But,’ said the mouse, ‘surely you know how I died. You are, are you not, Death?’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Ah’, said Death, tugging on his own whiskers.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Surely,’ said the mouse, ‘surely you are Death, are you not?’</p>
<p class="p1">‘I am Death,’ agreed Death.</p>
<p class="p1">‘And surely,’ said the mouse, ‘surely in that case you know how I died.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Ah,’ said Death, tugging for the sake of variety on the mouse’s whiskers. ‘Ah, certainly I do. But it is in question is whether <i>you</i> know how you died.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘But surely,’ said the mouse, ‘surely I must know how I died.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Ah,’ said Death, who had gone back to his own whiskers.</p>
<p class="p1">‘Now that you mention it,’ said the mouse, ‘I struggle to recall. Indeed, it is a curious thing that I should struggle to recall what can only just have happened.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘But,’ said the mouse, ‘whatever the specifics, it must have been ironic. I have been preparing for a long time, filling my house with safety signs with finely honed edges, and repainting every day BEWARE THE PIT’ in the wettest paint I could find. The pit itself, well, it is a larder full of the finest cheese, set to last me even in the longest famine. It is also very deep.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘I have seen it,’ said Death. ‘It is a very fine pit.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘A very fine pit, indeed,’ said the mouse. ‘And if you have seen it, surely it is that very fine and, if I may allow myself, deeply ironic pit that has sent me to my grave.’</p>
<p class="p1">‘Alas,’ said Death. ‘You were eaten by a cat.’</p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">The cat was enjoying a period of digestion. ‘Silly little mouse,’ he thought to himself. ‘You could probably have escaped if you weren’t concentrating so hard on that painting.’</p>
