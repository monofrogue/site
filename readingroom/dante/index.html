    <h2>Dante's <i>Commedia</i>, translated by Laurence Binyon</h2>
    <p>This was the first translation that really entrapped me, so I was surprised to see that, despite being out of copyright, it wasn't obviously available online. As a result, I have prepared the text and put it here for the enjoyment of all.</p>
    <p>There is a PDF version, which is much the best presented, <a href="binyon_dante.pdf">here.</a> However, the online version has the benefit of interactive annotations. You can start at the beginning <a href="inf1.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Click <a href="binyon_dante.epub">here</a> for EPUB and <a href="binyon_dante.txt">here</a> for the plaintext.</p>
